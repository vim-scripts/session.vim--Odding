The session.vim plug-in improves upon Vim's built-in :mksession command by enabling you to easily and (if you want) automatically persist and restore your Vim editing sessions. It works by generating a Vim script that restores your current settings and the arrangement of tab pages and/or split windows and the files they contain. For more information about the plug-in please refer to its homepage or the project page on GitHub:
